TechTalk is an online tech blog, which allows a user to create an account and start posting blog posts. Beyond that, a user is able to edit and delete posts as needed, as well as leave comments on other user's posts. This project uses user authentication to ensure that only password-protected accounts are able to make, edit, and delete posts or comments. Note: passwords are encrypted using the bcrypt npm package!
